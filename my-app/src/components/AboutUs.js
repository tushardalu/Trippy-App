      <h1> Our History</h1>
      <p>
        We believe travel makes the world a better place. Experiencing new
        places, cultures, and people leads to tolerance, understanding and
        empathy. Trippy is a community of travelers who believe in our mission
        and share our core values.
      </p>

      <h1> Our Misson</h1>
      <p>
        Trippy is for people who like to do good. We are helpers: no question is
        too great or too small. We've all experienced the kindness of strangers
        on our journeys and love to keep that momentum going by sharing with
        others.
      </p>

      <h1> Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        We live by the saying, "Take only pictures, leave only footprints." We
        would rather have a passport full of stamps than a house full of stuff.
      </p>
